GIT STUFF :

CODEPLEX REPOSITORY: http://tlaplus.codeplex.com

From Markus: In git speak:
* you "push" and "pull" commit to/from (remote) git repositories
* you "merge" or "rebase" commits across branches of a (local) git repository
* you "commit" or "revert" changes in a (local) branch of a (local) git repository


TO MAKE REVERT TO HEAD WORK
---------------------------
  After doing revert to HEAD, Eclipse reverts the file but still marks it as
  changed.  To unmark it, open a Cygwin shell and perform the command

      git checkout FileName

  where FileName is the path from the current directory to ~/git/tlaplus2/FileNameEclipseShows


TO IMPORT A REPOSITORY BRANCH
-----------------------------
1.  First make sure you have opened the EGit Repository view. 
    If you haven't opened it already, go to "Window -> Show View -> Other..." 
    and from there select "Git -> Git Repositories".

2. In the Repository view choose "Branches -> Remote Tracking".  You
   should see your remote branches there already (example:
   origin/new_feature).

3. Right click on the remote branch you wish to have with your local
   branches.  Choose "Create Branch..."

4. The default values should be OK. Normally you should not change
   anything here.  Please note that you should not change the "Pull
   strategy" to something else than "Merge" if you don't know what you
   are doing.  Otherwise pulling upstream changes might result in a loss
   of data.  
   
5. Click on OK "Finish" and you are done 


TO CREATE A NEW BRANCH
----------------------
- Select a package, right click, Team -> Switch To -> New branch

- Probably select Merge for Pull Option

- Commit will put the branch in the repository.
